            I have a profound interest in arts and design, including painting, photography and digital graphic design.
            Below are
            some of my art collections that marked my creative process.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started to capture the world as I see it after graduating from high school, when I owned my first Canon.
            That could be
            described as my first encounter with digital art creation. I began to be amazed by the light-and-shadow
            effects, as well
            as the fresh colors produced by photosensitive elements in the camera. Attached below are some of my
            favorite photos
            along the journey.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Painting
        </h2>
        <p>
            I observe and feel the way the texture of canvas and my paint brush interact through painting. I started
            painting
            watercolors when I was in primary school, when I was fascinated by Japanese anime and the cool characters.
            Gradually I
            became interested in oil painting and classics because that was how the majority of masterpieces in art
            history were
            created. The ultimate and most courageous attempt I took was to paint a friend’s wall–literally her wall
            upon which she
            would have to stare for every single day.

            My adventure with painting has never stopped--recently I began to draw on Procreate, which is a brand new
            experience,
            with all the cool features and vivid simulation of real-world rendering effects. I really hope someday I
            could curate my
            own gallery…
